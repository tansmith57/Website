<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The two datasets chosen for this project contain statstics for individual players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the current 2019-2020 NBA season. The datasets are from NBAstuffer.com and are updated everyday on this website. These datasets were received on March 6th, 2020, so the stats have been recorded from the beginning of the NBA season to March 6th. One dataset, “NBAstats”, has the general stats for the players such as, points per game and rebounds per game. The other dataset, “NBAadvancedstats”, has advanced statistics on players such as, offensive and defensive rating. Both of the datasets contain columns for player name, team they play on, and the player’s specifice position. Combining these datasets can allow us to see the impact of a players general stat on certain advanced stats. For example, a higher points per game could lead to a higher offensive rating or players. These datasets are interesting because it gives us an opporitunity to take a deep dive into these individual player stats and get a feeling for some of these player’s impact on the game.</p>

<p>I used the “full_join” function to join these two datasets because the “FULL.NAME”, “POS”, and “TEAM” variables were the same on both datasets which meant that each column had a match for both datasets. The full join function enabled the two datasets to combine with each unnique variable and their subsequent data. Using this function, the new “Stats” dataset has a total of 7 columns which includes the 3 columns the two datasets have in common, the 2 unique columns from the “NBAstats” dataset, and the 2 unique columns from the “NBAadvancedstats” dataset. “Stats” has the following varibale: Full Name, Team, Position, Points per Game, Rebounds per Game, Offensive Rating, and Defensive Rating. I also omitted any NA’s from the dataset which appeared for players who haven’t logged enough stats to get an offensive or defensive rating.</p>

<div id="summary-stats" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary Stats</h2>
<p>I found various summary statistics for the combined dataset to show a better overall picture of the data presented in the dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Stats %&gt;% summarize(n_distinct(POS), n_distinct(TEAM))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   n_distinct(POS) n_distinct(TEAM)
## 1               3               30</code></pre>
<p>The n_distinct results show that there are 3 different positions and 30 different teams in the dataset. This goes along with common knowledge because there are 30 teams in the NBA and 3 general positions usually documented. The 3 positions are center (C), forward (F), and guard (G).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Stats %&gt;% mutate(PPGandRPG = PPG+RPG) %&gt;% group_by(POS) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean = mean(PPGandRPG), sd=sd(PPGandRPG))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   POS    mean    sd
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 C      15.6  8.55
## 2 F      12.2  8.42
## 3 G      11.2  8.03</code></pre>
<p>This summary statistic shows a new variable being created using the mutate function. This new function, named “PPGandRPG”, is the sum of points per game and rebounds per game for each player. This new variable better illustrates a player’s overall impact for his team as a whole. After the new variable was created, I grouped the dataset by position then found the mean and standard deviation for PPGandRPG using the summarize function. Since the dataset was grouped by position, the end result shows the mean and standard deviation for the three different positions on the dataset. The result shows that the center (C) position has a higher PPGandRPG on average compared to the other two positions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Stats %&gt;% summarize(median(PPG))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   median(PPG)
## 1         7.1</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>Stats %&gt;% filter(DRtg &gt; median(DRtg)) %&gt;% summarize(median(PPG))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   median(PPG)
## 1        8.75</code></pre>
<p>The median points per game for the entire dataset was found to be 7.1 points per game while using the summarize function. The filter function was used to find the median points per game of players who had a defensive rating greater than the median defensive rating of the dataset. The result of this was 8.75 points per game. This shows that players with a higher defensive rating show a trend of scoring more points. this increase could also be due to the lower sampling size after filtering out half of the dataset.</p>

<p>This code shows the median for the four numeric variables grouped by position and team. The results were also arranged in descending values of the medians. The results for rebounds show that the center’s (C) of the Detroit Pistons (Det) have the highest median. The results for Points show that the Center’s (C) for the Denver Nuggets (Den) have the highest median. The results for Offensive Rating show that the Center’s (C) for the Utah Jazz have the highest median. The results for Defensive Rating show that the guard’s (G) for the Portland Trailblazers have the highest median.</p>

<p>The mean offensive and defensive rating was found for each position on the dataset. The results show that centers (C) had the highest mean offensive rating, and guards (G) had the highest mean defensive rating. This shows that centers on average have been more efficient on the offensive side and guards have been more efficient on the defensive side.</p>

<p>A clustering analysis was ran on this dataset using the PAM function. The silhouette width graph of the dataset showed that there should be 2 clusters in the cluster analysis. The clustering graph made of each variable, except Names and Teams, doesn’t show very distinct clusters. This isn’t the only way to test the clustering abilities of the data. The average cluster width was found to find the clustering ability better. This width was found to be less than 0.25 which means there was no substantial clustering in this data.</p>
